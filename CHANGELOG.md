# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project adheres loosely to Semantic Versioning.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-05-04

### Change 11

- Simplified the README to focus on the actual end-user setup and usage path
- Improved LM Studio CLI detection so the extension also checks common install locations instead of requiring `lms` to be on `PATH`
- Tightened the extension icon artwork inside `assets/Latest.png` so it fills the Marketplace icon frame more effectively

## [0.1.10] - 2026-05-04

### Change 10

- Added LM Studio CLI-backed startup so the extension can auto-start the daemon/server without requiring a manual command
- Switched model discovery to include installed local models from `lms ls --json`, not just models already loaded into the server
- Added lazy model loading so a model selected in Copilot Chat is loaded on the first prompt automatically
- Switched the extension marketplace icon to `assets/Latest.png`

## [0.1.9] - 2026-05-03

### Change 9

- Switched the extension marketplace icon to the new LM Studio logo asset

## [0.1.8] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- New `lmstudio-copilot.reasoningEffort` setting (`"default"` / `"low"` / `"medium"` / `"high"`) — sends the `reasoning_effort` parameter to models that support it (o1, o3, QwQ, and similar reasoning-capable models)
- Documented the existing `lmstudio-copilot.enableThinking` setting and added a dedicated "Extended thinking and reasoning effort" section to the README with usage examples

## [0.1.7] - 2026-04-03

### Change 8

- (Release placeholder — identical to 0.1.6 with changelog update)

## [0.1.6] - 2026-04-03

### Change 7

- Replaced Qwen-specific model-name sniffing with two user-controlled settings:
  - `lmstudio-copilot.injectSystemPrompt` — toggle the extension's system prompt injection (default: on)
  - `lmstudio-copilot.enableThinking` — toggle the `enable_thinking` parameter for thinking/CoT models (default: on)
- Removed `isQwenFamilyModel()` helpers from both provider and client — settings now apply to all model families

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-27

### Change 6

- Improved Qwen-family model compatibility by normalizing outgoing messages before sending requests
- Added safer content sanitization for outgoing chat payloads to reduce malformed tool-call interactions
- Updated provider behavior to avoid injecting an extra system prompt when the target model or message layout already handles it

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-27

### Change 5

- Updated extension marketplace metadata and publisher alignment for release consistency
- Switched to a PNG-only extension icon bundle and removed unused SVG icon assets

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-19

### Change 4

- Refined the bundled extension icon based on the uploaded design: added a white background card, removed outer border bars, and adjusted the lower LM Studio symbol for cleaner overlap at small sizes

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-19

### Change 3

- Replaced the text-heavy extension icon with a cleaner LM-style monogram mark for better small-size readability

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-18

- LM Studio model discovery and Copilot Chat provider integration
- Streaming chat completions through the LM Studio OpenAI-compatible API
- Built-in tools for terminal, file read/write, directory listing, file search, and image generation
- Optional Automatic1111 and DALL-E-compatible image generation support
- Tool budgeting for local models via `lmstudio-copilot.maxTools`
- Commands to refresh models, start the LM Studio server, stop the server terminal, and check connectivity

### Change 1

- Improved repository metadata, README, licensing, and packaging scripts for GitHub and Marketplace readiness
